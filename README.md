# Interactive profile. (profile-ai)

Interactive profile frontend using [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/).

## Development state

Somewhere between "Make it work" and "Make it right".

## Install the dependencies
```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

However, that will not work, since there are dependencies, that are not public yet.

### Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)
```bash
quasar dev
```

### Lint the files
```bash
yarn lint
# or
npm run lint
```

### Build the app for production
```bash
quasar build
```

### Customize the configuration
See [Configuring quasar.config.js](https://v2.quasar.dev/quasar-cli-vite/quasar-config-js).
